# wordlist generation

This is just a simple wordlist generator coded in Python. The master branch uses a character set of 0-9 and special characters but the testing branch allows you to input your own character set to edit the outcomes. 

The prefixes are counted and subtracted from the length of the password you suggest. 

Leetcode variations will be added automatically and duplicates are removed.
